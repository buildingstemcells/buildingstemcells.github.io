                        (NSF GRFP) is a five-year fellowship
                        that supports graduate masters and doctoral students who are pursuing degrees in fields of Science,
                        Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), with an annual stipend of $34,000 for three of the 
                        five years of the fellowship. Check this page for tips on how to craft <a href="#nsfstatement">the Personal Statement</a>,

                        The opening paragraph of the personal statement should be long enough that the reviewers
                        get a good sense of who you are and what you are interested in within the first few words, but short 
                        enough that your writing doesn't sound too forced and generic. A sentence can be dedicated to how you
                        got interested in research, and what specific studies you're looking to work on in graduate school and 
                        beyond.

                    <p class="peepee_desc">
                        The main and largest portion of your NSF personal statement should be dedicated to the research 
                        you conducted during your time as an undergraduate student. Did you complete any Research Experience
                        for Undergraduate (REU) or other summer research programs, co-ops, or research internships? If so,
                        include them here. It is best to go in chronological order of experiences, and if you have many contributions
                        to research, limit your essay to the work that most contributed to your path as a growing research scientist.
                        Each important research experience merits an entire paragraph. For each paragraph, list the name of the program
                        or research experience, so that reviewers can connect this to the broad application materials that you fill out in
                        the essay. Then, take some time to describe the objectives of the project, your contributions, and some skills that you picked up.
                        skills you obtained during this experience. Mention any publications, presentations, or opportunities to continue
                        your work as well.

                        Given that you spent a significant portion of your personal statement laying the foundations of your research background,
                        the next important thing for reviewers to see is how your previous work inspires your current research interests.

                        NSF likes to see that their applicants are not only academically-oriented, but community-oriented as well. A good scientist
                        cares about their work, but a great scientist cares about how their work can benefit others. If you have completed any teaching
                        assistantships, volunteering experience, were involved in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) for STEM, or other related opportunities,
                        describe them here.

                        NSF values a scientist's ability to connect their work with the community. How have your past involvements with
                        research, volunteering, and teaching shaped the scientist that you are today? In what ways do you hope or continue to contribute to  
                        your dedicated field of interest, and how do you want the broader community outside of your field to benefit from your involvement?
                        These questions can be addressed in the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts section of your personal statement, and is perhaps the 
                        most important component of the essay.

                        It helps to have transition sentences that show the connections between each experience.
                        Separate your sections with main headers, so that reviewers can clearly locate your research experience,
                        community involvement, and future vision.
